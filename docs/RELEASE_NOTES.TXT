# 1.11 - 8/26/2013
  - Fixed bug where default isohyet map was based on zero map instead
    of a map with values of onehundred.  When the zero map was used,
    there would be no precipitation in a model, instead, by default
    when isohyet map is specified, precipitation should be scaled by
    1.0 (i.e. no scaling)

# 1.1 - 7/30/2013
  - Compatible with recently released RHESSys 5.18
  - Adds workflow for creating climate base station maps 
  - Makes patch the default zone map (instead of hillslope)
  - Separates template generation from worldfile creation
  - Note: Version number is 1.1 indicating that metadata from this
    version is not compatible with previous versions

# 1.0 - 7/12/2013
  - Initial release
