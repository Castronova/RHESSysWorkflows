# 1.31 - 6/15/2015
  - Update RHESSysPlotMassbalance to read precip. data from observed data 
    instead of from modeled data

# 1.30 - 4/20/2015
  - Fix bug where isohyet will be scaled by 1/100th of values in isohyet map

# 1.29 - 3/25/2015
  - Save stream reach raster in DelineateWatershed

# 1.28 - 3/18/2015
  - Update ImportRHESSysSource to checkout RHESSys version 5.18.2 by 
    default (i.e. the latest stable version)

# 1.27 - 3/6/2015
  - Added ability to create multiple worldfiles based on subbasins
  - Fixed bug where ImportRHESSysSource would incorrectly record Git commit
  	SHA when the --commit option was specified

# 1.26 - 2/25/2015
  - Added ability to checkout a particular commit of RHESSys

# 1.25 - 2/10/2015
  - Fix bug where GeneratePatchMap would incorrectly create gridded patch 
    maps which could lead to duplicate fully qualified patch IDs in rare cases.

# 1.24 - 1/19/2015
  - Improved generation of LAI maps from landcover data by adding support 
    for floating point LAI maps.

# 1.23 - 8/24/2014
  - Added ability to specify stream search window size for r.findtheriver
    when running DelineateWatershed.py

# 1.22 - 4/1/2014
  - Fixed bugs in RHESSysPlot and PatchToMovie to ensure Linux campatibility

# 1.21 - 3/31/2014
  - Added beta versions of visualization tools: RHESSysPlot and PatchToMovie.

# 1.20 - 2/28/2024
  - Fixed validation of multiple climate stations in GenerateWorldTemplate.

# 1.19 - 2/24/2014
  - GenerateWorldTemplate now transform DEM	to scaled integer to work 
    around limitations in g2w.

# 1.18 - 2/17/2014
  - Added ability to use slope map with minimum slope of 1.0 when 
    calculating spherical average of aspect

# 1.17 - 2/13/2014
  - Added ability to build RHESSys model using DEM with streams burned in

# 1.16 - 1/18/2014
  - Added ability to transform a raster map to integer format on import
  - Added ability to skip creating road map to GenerateLandcoverMaps

# 1.15 - 11/12/2013
  - Allow models to be run in both routing and TOPMODEL mode

# 1.14 - 11/6/2013
  - Added ability to generate LAI map from landcover map

# 1.13 - 10/23/2013
  - Fixed handling of hierarchical stratum definitions

# 1.12 - 9/25/2013
  - Added RunModel.py to allow capture of RHESSys model runs in the 
    metadata for a project

# 1.11 - 8/26/2013
  - Fixed bug where default isohyet map was based on zero map instead
    of a map with values of onehundred.  When the zero map was used,
    there would be no precipitation in a model, instead, by default
    when isohyet map is specified, precipitation should be scaled by
    1.0 (i.e. no scaling)

# 1.1 - 7/30/2013
  - Compatible with recently released RHESSys 5.18
  - Adds workflow for creating climate base station maps 
  - Makes patch the default zone map (instead of hillslope)
  - Separates template generation from worldfile creation
  - Note: Version number is 1.1 indicating that metadata from this
    version is not compatible with previous versions

# 1.0 - 7/12/2013
  - Initial release
