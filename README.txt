Introduction
------------
RHESSysWorkflows provides a series of Python scripts for performing
[RHESSys](http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~rhessys/) data preparation
workflows.  These scripts build on the workflow system defined by
[EcohydrologyWorkflowLib](https://github.com/selimnairb/EcohydrologyWorkflowLibWorkflow).

Configuration files
-------------------
Many scripts in both RHESSysWorkflows and EcohydroLib
require a configuration file to specify locations to executables and
datasets required by the ecohydrology workflow libraries.  The
configuration file can be specified via the environmental variable
ECOHYDROLIB_CFG or via command line option. Here is an example
configuration file:

		[GDAL/OGR]
		PATH_OF_OGR2OGR = /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/Current/Programs/ogr2ogr
		PATH_OF_GDAL_RASTERIZE = /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/Current/Programs/gdal_rasterize
		PATH_OF_GDAL_WARP = /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/Current/Programs/gdalwarp
		PATH_OF_GDAL_TRANSLATE = /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/Current/Programs/gdal_translate
		
		[NHDPLUS2]
		PATH_OF_NHDPLUS2_DB = /Users/<myusername>/data/NHDPlusDB.sqlite
		PATH_OF_NHDPLUS2_CATCHMENT = /Users/<myusername>/data/Catchment.sqlite
		PATH_OF_NHDPLUS2_GAGELOC = /Users/<myusername>/data/GageLoc.sqlite
		
		[NLCD]
		PATH_OF_NLCD2006 = /Users/<myusername>/data/nlcd2006_landcover_4-20-11_se5.img
		
		[UTIL]
		PATH_OF_FIND = /usr/bin/find
		#PATH_OF_SEVEN_ZIP = /opt/local/bin/7z
		PATH_OF_SQLITE = /usr/bin/sqlite3
		
		[SCRIPT]
		ETC = /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/rhessysworkflows/etc
		
		[GRASS]
		GISBASE = /Applications/GRASS-6.4.app/Contents/MacOS
		MODULE_PATH = /Library/GRASS/6.4/Modules/bin
		MODULE_ETC = /Library/GRASS/6.4/Modules/etc
		
		[RHESSYS]
		PATH_OF_GIT = /usr/bin/git
		PATH_OF_MAKE = /usr/bin/make
		

Installation
------------

1. Install non-Python dependencies

  - OS X 10.6 through 10.8:

	1. Xcode (OS X developer tools):
		OS X 10.6: 
		OS X 10.7 and 10.8:
			- Install Xcode from the App Store
			- Launch Xcode
			- Install 'Command Line Tools':
				- Xcode > Preferencesâ€¦ > Downloads
	
	2. Python 2.7:
		If you are running OS X 10.6, you must first install Python 2.7, which can be downloaded from:
	3. 

  - Linux: 


2. Install PIP, a tool for installing Python modules

sudo easy_install pip


3. Install RHESSysWorkflows (including EcohydroLib) Python modules

[Linux: 'sudo pip install GDAL' first]

sudo pip install rhessysworkflows


4. Setup NLCD2006 data [optional]

  If you want to use NLCD2006 land cover data, do the following:

  - Download NLCD2006 data from:

  - Copy NLCD2006 archive to the parent folder where you would like to store it
    - For example, under OS X, create a folder called 'data' in your home directory

  - Unpack NLCD2006 data
    - For example, under OS X, DO NOT double-click on the NLCD2006 archive, but instead
      unzip the data from Terminal:
      	unzip NLCD2005_landcover_4-20-11.se5.zip


5. Setup pre-packaged NHDPlusV2 data [optional]

If you want to determine your study area based on an NHD catchment drained by a USGS streamflow gage, do the following:

  - Download pre-packaged NHDPlusV2 data from:
  
  	Note, this may take a while to download

  - Copy the pre-packaged NHDPlusV2 archive to the parent folder where you would like to store it
    - For example, under OS X, create a folder called 'data' in your home directory

  - Unpack NHDPlusV2 data (e.g. into your "Documents" folder)
    - For example, under OS X, double-click on the NHDPlusV2 archive. Note, this may take a while to unpack


6. Setup EcohydroLib and RHESSys workflows configuration file

  - Copy and paste example configuration into a text file named '.ecohydro.cfg', save this file in your home directory.

  - Modify example configuration to point to your NHDPlusV2 and NLCD2006 data:
    - If you are using OS X, and if you placed the data in a directory called 'data' in your
      home directory, the only changes you need to make is to substitute '<myusername>' with your user name.
        - To find out your OS X user name, enter the following in your Terminal:
          whoami
         
  - Set ECOHYDROLIB_CFG environment variable:
    - For example, under OS X, from your terminal, do the following:
	- Open your bash profile in an editor:
		nano ~/.bash_profile
	- Add the following at the end of the file:
		export ECOHYDROLIB_CFG=${HOME}/.ecohydro.cfg
	- Save the file
	- Re-load your bash profile (or close and open a new Terminal window):
		source ~/.bash_profile


How to use - Typical workflow
-------------------------------
A typical workflow will consist of running data
processing/registration scripts from EcohydrologyWorkflowLib.  Once
the required datasets are in place (e.g. DEM, soils, landcover, etc.)
the following RHESSysWorkflows scripts should be run (in the order
listed):

1. CreateGRASSLocationFromDEM.py
2. DelineateWatershed.py
3. GenerateLandcoverMaps.py
4. GenerateSoilTextureMap.py

Import RHESSys source (requires RHESSys 5.16 or later, for now use the develop branch)
